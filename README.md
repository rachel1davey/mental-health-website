## Design & Planning:

### User Stories

- **As a first-time visitor**, I want a gentle introduction to mental health, so I can understand it without feeling overwhelmed.
- **As someone curious about mental health**, I want to explore common issues explained in clear, everyday language, so I feel more informed and less confused.
- **As a caregiver or friend**, I want to understand signs of mental health challenges, so I can better support someone I care about.

- **As someone feeling stressed**, I want to see practical tips for coping, so I can get help quickly without needing to search far.
- **As a busy student or professional**, I want short and actionable advice, so I can use it even on hectic days.

- **As a user carrying emotional weight**, I want to submit an anonymous message to get something off my chest, so I can feel relief without fear of judgment.

- **As a person looking for professional help**, I want easy access to hotlines and support links, so I know where to turn in moments of need.
- **As a user in crisis**, I want urgent resources to be clearly visible, so I can get help fast and safely.

- **As a person navigating tough emotions**, I want positive affirmations displayed throughout the page, so I feel supported and understood.
- **As a user who’s emotionally sensitive**, I want soft colors and calming design, so the page doesn’t add to my stress.
- **As someone seeking reassurance**, I want messages like “You’re doing your best” or “You matter,” so I feel encouraged.

- **As a beginner to websites**, I want a clear, intuitive layout, so I don’t get lost or frustrated while browsing.
- **As a mobile user**, I want everything to work well on my phone, so I can access support wherever I am.
- **As a user with a disability**, I want the site to be readable and navigable with screen readers.

All user stories have passed :)

### Wireframes
Basic Wireframe Design:

### Typography
In my project, I used the Google Font Inter.

### Colour Scheme

### AI Influences
During this project, I decided to utilize AI (specifically copilot)

AI assisted me in:
- Debugging code
- Creating user stories

## Features:
For this project, I wanted to create a safe, calming space to raise awareness about mental health.

My goals for this project were to:

- Create a fully responsive single page website.
- Maintain a consistent design theme.
  
- Educate the user on what mental health is and 'commom' mental health issues.
- Provide the user with the appropriate mental health resources if they may need it.
- Ensure the user is equipped with mental health 'coping methods'

### Navigation
To ensure responsiveness across all devices and maintain simplicity and ease of use, I decided the best option for navigation was a simple burger navbar that collapses on mobile devices.
### Footer
In order to keep the website simplistic and not too confusing for the user, I decided on a simple 'return to top' button in the footer 
which redirects the user to the top of the webpage.
### Other features

Common Issues 
Cards that open modals with more information on 'common issues'.

Mental Health Tips 
Simple bootstrap accordian sharing mental health tips.

Daily Affirmations 
Bootstrap carousel of affirmations (swipable on touch screen devices).

Helpful Resources 
Simple bootstrap buttons that share 'helpful resources'.

Share Anonymously
Text box that allows the user to 'share their feelings'.
